      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2013 Problem 7<br>This problem has a difficulty of 30</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Introduction</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Brenda Sue just opened a new cupcake store.  Brenda is more interested in baking than handling the money, and wants to make it easier for everyone to give the correct change.  Write a program for Brenda Sue that determines the correct amount of change to return to her customers.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The file Prob07.in.txt will contain a list of amounts customers owe and how much money the customers gave Brenda Sue.  There will be one pair of numbers per line, and the numbers will be separated by a comma and a space.  Both numbers will always have two decimal places.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       3.54, 10.00<br>
       16.87, 20.00<br>
       1.23, 5.00<br>
       4.78, 5.03<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Your program’s output should display the amount of money returned to the customer, and a list of the monetary values returned all separated by a comma and a space.  An equal sign with no extra space should be between the denomination and the integer number corresponding to how many of that denomination to give to the customer.  The change should always be broken down by largest possible denomination; the customer doesn’t want excess change or bills.  For example, a quarter should be used instead of 5 nickels.  The list of valid denominations is: TWENTY, TEN, FIVE, ONE, QUARTER, DIME, NICKEL, PENNY.  If no change is owed, print the word NONE.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       $6.46, FIVE=1, ONE=1, QUARTER=1, DIME=2, PENNY=1<br>
       $3.13, ONE=3, DIME=1, PENNY=3<br>
       $3.77, ONE=3, QUARTER=3, PENNY=2<br>
       $.25, QUARTER=1<br>
