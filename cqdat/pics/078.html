       OK, OK, we know everyone pays their bills online these days but there are still some occasions where a check is called for.  To help with these few occasions, write a program that converts dollar amounts from their numeric form into their English equivalent, as would be seen on a check.  <br>
       <br>
       Guidelines:<br>
       1.	Not all input numbers will have a decimal.  Numbers with no decimal should be assumed to have 0 Cents.<br>
       2.	There will be no more than 2 numbers after the decimal point.<br>
       3.	Capitalize each English word except the word “and”.<br>
       4.	All inputs will be less than one million.<br>
       5.	You should use the singular for Dollar and Cent when appropriate.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The file Prob09.in.txt will contain a list of numbers, one per line.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       143<br>
       2.34<br>
       1.01<br>
       1234.56<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Your program should output the English version of each number in the input file in the order it was encountered in the file.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       One Hundred Forty Three Dollars and 0 Cents<br>
       Two Dollars and 34 Cents<br>
       One Dollar and 1 Cent<br>
       One Thousand Two Hundred Thirty Four Dollars and 56 Cents<br>
