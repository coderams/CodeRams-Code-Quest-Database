      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2014 Problem 11<br>This problem has a difficulty of 60</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>

       <br>
       If you’ve ever looked at a word search puzzle and thought “hey, I wonder if there’s some hidden message in there somewhere?” then this problem is for you.  Your task is to take some text and create a counter clockwise spiral out of it.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The file Prob11.in.txt will contain some number of lines of text.  Your program should read in the text and print it out in a counter clockwise spiral.  Here are the parameters for creating the spiral:<br>
       •	The spiral should be contained within a square, and the square should be as small as possible.<br>
       •	The first character of the text should go in the exact center of the square.<br>
       •	The second character of text should go to the left of the first character.<br>
       •	The spiral of text should go counter clockwise from there.<br>
       •	Insert spaces as necessary to separate words from different lines (watch out for input lines with leading and/or trailing spaces).<br>
       •	When you reach the end of the text, fill the remainder of the spiral with spaces.<br>
       <br>

You should
turn this
text into
a spiral.
     </pre><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Your program should print the text in spiral form as described above.  Again, take a look at the example file provided.  The extra spaces are not readily apparent here.<br>
