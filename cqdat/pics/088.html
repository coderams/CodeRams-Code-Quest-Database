       Often, when working with files, itâ€™s helpful to separate the extension from the filename.   This is useful when wanting to perform an action on certain type of file.  An example would when you want to move or rename all text files.  Your task is to take a list of filenames as input and create a list of extensions along with their count.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The file Prob03.in.txt will contain a list of filenames with extensions.  Each filename will be on its own line.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       File1.txt<br>
       File2.doc<br>
       File3.out<br>
       File4.txt<br>
       File5.so<br>
       File6.dll<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The output of the program should be the list of file extensions without the dot, followed by the number of times the extension was found.  A single space should be between the extension and the count.  The extensions will each be on separate lines and should only be listed once.  List the file extensions in the order that you encounter them in the input file.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       txt 2<br>
       doc 1<br>
       out 1<br>
       so 1<br>
       dll 1<br>
