      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 7<br>This problem has a difficulty of 50</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>

       You are patrolling national air-space in an F-22 Raptor and your radar indicates incoming alien robot invaders.  Your directive is to destroy each ship starting with the closest and ending with the furthest.  Each time you destroy one ship, all remaining ships advance closer to you, but at differing rates.  Class-A ships advance 10 X-units, Class-B ships advance 20 X-units, and Class-C ships advance 30 X-units.<br>
       <br>
       For the purposes of this problem you are trying to protect the Y axis, so the closest ship is the one with the lowest X coordinate.  In the event of a tie, you should destroy the ship with the largest Y coordinate first.  Negative X coordinates are fine – it just means the aliens have invaded your airspace!<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob07.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line of each test case will contain a positive integer N denoting the number of alien ships that follow.<br>
       •	The next N lines will contain a description of an alien ship in the following format:<br>
       <br>
       [ShipName]_[Class]:[X],[Y][br]
       <br>
       The ship name and the class of the ship will be separated by an underscore.  The class and the X coordinate will be separated by a colon.  The X and Y coordinates will be separated by a comma.<br>
