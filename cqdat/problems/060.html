       The goal of a word search is simple: find words in a block of letters either up, down, left, right, or diagonally.  We have all played this game hundreds of times.  But this isn’t your run-of-the-mill word maze.  Today you will search for a word worm that bends its way in any direction through a block of letters.  The worm may even overlap itself.  Don’t let him get away!<br>
       <br>
       Here are the properties of word worms:<br>
       •	Word worms can move left, right, up, down, and diagonally.<br>
       •	Word worms can overlap other word worms (even itself).<br>
       <br>
       Here is an example of a word worm spelling the word LOCKHEED:<br>
       <br>
     </p><p id="code"><br>
       A D E K H E Q<br>
       B X E H K J R<br>
       J I L O C K D<br>
       R P I G N A H<br>
       T E N E F H M<br>
       J U O P L N T<br><br>
     </p><p id="ptext">
       <br>

       As another example, the following could be used to spell the word BANANA:<br>
       <br>
       B A N<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob06.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line of each test case will contain two space separated positive integers in the form R C, where R is the number of rows in the puzzle and C is the number of columns in the puzzle.<br>
       •	The next R lines will each contain C space separated capital letters – this is the puzzle board.<br>
       •	The next line of each test case will contain a positive integer N denoting the number of words that follow.<br>
       •	The next N lines of each test case will contain a single word in all capital letters.  These are the words to search for in the puzzle.<br>

       Your program should print the list of words that were found in the grid, in the order they were listed in the input file.  If a word could not be found, do not print it out.<br>
