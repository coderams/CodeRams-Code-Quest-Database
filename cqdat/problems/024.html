      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 5<br>This problem has a difficulty of 25</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>
       A local charity has hired you to help organize their lists of donors.  The organization has a list of people who donated to the organization last year, and another list of this year’s donors.  The group wants to send emails to three groups of people:<br>
       <br>
       •	People who donated last year but didn’t this year<br>
       •	People who donated both years<br>
       •	People who donated this year but didn’t last year<br>
       <br>
       Each group will receive a different email, so they need to know which donors belong to each group.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob05.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line of each test case will contain a comma separated list of the names of last year’s donors.<br>
       •	The second line of each test case will contain a comma separated list of the names of this year’s donors.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code">
       <br>
       2<br>
       Bob,Joe,Steve,Mary,Ann<br>
       Bob,Steve,Ann,Paula,Chris<br>
       Bill,Ted,Liz,Quinn<br>
       Quinn,Liz,Ken,Bill<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Each of your test cases should output three lines:<br>
       <br>
       •	On the first line, output a comma separated list of donors who gave last year but not this year.<br>
       •	On the second line, output a comma separated list of donors who gave both last year and this year.<br>
       •	On the third line, output a comma separated list of donors who gave this year but not last year.<br>
       <br>
       Each list of names should be sorted alphabetically.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code">
       <br>
       Joe,Mary<br>
