      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 10<br>This problem has a difficulty of 55</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>
       The home keys on a keyboard are imperative to quick typing if you are a touch typist, but what if you are off just one key?  Imagine you accidentally placed your left index finger at D instead of F and your right index finger at H instead of J.  Translate the following message as if you were retyping it with the wrong home key finger placement.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob10.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line of each test case will be a positive integer N denoting how many lines of text the message contains.<br>
       •	The next N lines will contain the message that needs to be translated.<br>
       <br>
       Input Constraints:<br>
       •	The input messages will be case sensitive.  Since Shift is a wide key, the wrong hand placement has no effect on pressing that key.<br>
       •	Your typing boundaries are:<br>
       o	Top row: from Q to P<br>
       o	Middle row: from A to L<br>
       o	Bottom row: from Z to .<br>
       o	There will be no numbers<br>

       Your program should print out what would appear if your hands were off one place to the left.  Here are some assumptions:<br>
       •	Caps Lock starts out being off for each new test case.  Notice that attempting to hit the A key with your hands in the wrong place will turn caps lock on and off.  Shift-Caps Lock is the same as just hitting Caps Lock (in case there is a capital A in the original message).<br>
       •	Tabs should be output as 4 spaces, not a real tab.<br>
