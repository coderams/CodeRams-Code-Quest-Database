      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 5<br>This problem has a difficulty of 20</em></p>      <p id="ptext">

       <br>
       Nobody likes a miser!  Whether you are riding in a cab or eating out, tipping is something that service industry workers count on for their livelihood.  However, sometimes people do the math wrong in their heads, and workers that did a good job get stuck with a tip that’s too little.  Your task is to help stop this bad mental math epidemic.<br>
       <br>
       Your program will read a file with various bill amounts from fine dining restaurants and calculate the gratuity as a percentage of the bill.  As is customary in U.S. restaurants, gratuity typically ranges from 15%-20% of the bill, so your program needs to calculate the gratuities at the 15%, 18% and 20% levels (rounding to the nearest cent using the CodeQuest rounding guidelines found in Appendix A) and display this in the output.  You will get no points for claiming bad service and leaving a 0% tip on the bill!<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob05.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	A single line containing the dollar amount of your bill.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       4<br>
       $73.26<br>
       $16.38<br>
       $89.34<br>
       $287.36<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       For each dollar amount given, your program should output the tip amounts in the following format:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line should contain the text “Total of the bill: “ followed by the original dollar amount spent in the restaurant as it appeared in the input.<br>
       •	The next line should contain the text “15% = “ followed by the 15% tip amount calculated.  Round to the nearest cent (two decimal places).<br>
       •	The next line should contain the text “18% = “ followed by the 18% tip amount calculated.  Round to the nearest cent (two decimal places).<br>
       •	The next line should contain the text “20% = “  followed by the 20% tip amount calculated.  Round to the nearest cent (two decimal places).<br>
       •	Please note that there is a space between the colon and the original amount in the first line of your output.  There are also spaces on either side of the equal sign for the last three lines of your output.<br>
