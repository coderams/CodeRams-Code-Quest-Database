       In the classroom, the three R’s are Reading, wRiting, and aRithmetic.  In real estate, the three L’s are Location, Location, and Location.  Today we are going to learn about the three M’s of statistics.  They are the Mean, Median, and Mode.  Your job is to write a program to calculate these three values for a given data set.<br>
       <br>
       The Mean of a set of data is simply the average.  The Median is the value that is exactly in the middle, if the data set were sorted.  In the event that there is an even number of values, the Median is the Mean of the two numbers in the middle of the data set.  The Mode is the number (or numbers) that occur the most often in the data set.<br>

       <br>
       The file Prob09.in.txt will contain sets of integers separated by commas.  Each set will be on its own line.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       1,5,3,4,2,5<br>
       2,1,3,1,2<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Your program should print the set number along with the values of the mean, median, and mode that you calculated for each set.  If your answers are not integers, print only one decimal place.  If there is more than one mode, sort them low to high and separate the numbers by commas.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       Set 1: Mean=3.3, Median=3.5, Mode=5<br>
       Set 2: Mean=1.8, Median=2, Mode=1,2<br>
       <br>
