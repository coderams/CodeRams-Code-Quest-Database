      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 7<br>This problem has a difficulty of 25</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>
       In baseball statistics, the slugging percentage (SLG) is a popular measure of the power of a hitter.  You will be given a list of players and their at-bats for a single game.  You will need to compute each player’s slugging percentage.  For this exercise, no player will be hit by a pitch.<br>
       <br>
       The slugging percentage is found by counting all the singles, doubles, triples, and home runs in a given game and applying a set weight to each achievement (home runs are worth more than singles), then dividing that number by the total number of at-bats in that game as shown here:<br>

       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob07.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	A single line of input per player consisting of the batter’s name, a colon, and some number of at-bats separated by commas.<br>
       <br>
       A player’s at bats can be any of the following:<br>
       <br>
       •	BB means the player was walked by the pitcher and does NOT count as an at-bat.<br>
       •	K is an at-bat where the player struck out and did not reach a base.<br>
       •	1B is an at-bat where the player hit a single.<br>
       •	2B is an at-bat where the player hit a double.<br>
       •	3B is an at-bat where the player hit a triple.<br>
       •	HR is an at-bat where the player hit a home run.<br>
       <br>
       Please note that not every player in the game has the same number of at bats.  If a player has no at-bats, then their slugging percentage should be 0.<br>
       <br>

       <br>
       For each test case, your program should output the player’s name, as it appeared in the input, an equal sign and then their slugging percentage rounded to 3 decimal places, no spaces.  Use the standard Code Quest rounding rules found in Appendix A.<br>
