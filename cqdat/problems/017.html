       Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3 x 3 grid.  The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins the game.<br>
       <br>
       The following example game is won by the first player, X:<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       You have been hired by CoolGames, Inc. to create a tic-tac-toe checker program that they can use to determine whether X wins, O wins, or if a tie has resulted.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob17.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	A single line of characters denoting the current state of a Tic-Tac-Toe game<br>
       <br>
       The game state will represented as follows:<br>
       <1 VALUE><2 VALUE><3 VALUE><4 VALUE><5 VALUE><6 VALUE><7 VALUE><8 VALUE><9 VALUE><br>

       In Figure 1, it shows how the values in the tic-tac-toe board are mapped.  In Figure 2, it shows an example tic-tac-toe game being played where "-" means no one has played in the area.  In Figure 3, it shows how the tic-tac-toe game is encoded into a string of values based on the board mapping.<br>

       For each test case, your program should output one line in the following format:<br>
       <br>
       •	The original input line followed by a single space, an equal sign, and another single space<br>
       •	One of the following three phrases depending on the outcome of the game:<br>
       o	X WINS<br>
       o	O WINS<br>
