       Soundex is a phonetic hashing algorithm that groups together names that sound similar yet have minor differences in spelling.  It can be useful for genealogical studies by identifying variations for a given surname.  The hashing part of the algorithm uses the following character groups:<br>
       •	Group 1: b, f, p, v<br>
       •	Group 2: c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z<br>
       •	Group 3: d, t<br>
       •	Group 4: l<br>
       •	Group 5: m, n<br>
       •	Group 6: r<br>
       •	Wild: h, w<br>
       •	Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y<br>
       <br>
       An American Soundex code for a name consists of a letter followed by a three digit number.  The code can be determined by the following steps:<br>
       1.	Find the first letter in the name that belongs to one of the numbered groups.  Starting from that letter and working left to right, if two or more letters from the same numbered group are adjacent to one another, remove all but the first letter.  Note that h and w are “wild” meaning that they will match letters from any group 1-6.<br>
       2.	Retain the first letter of the name and remove all vowels and wild letters.<br>
       3.	Retain the first letter of the name and replace all other letters with their group number.<br>
       4.	If there are less than three numbers, add zeroes until there are three.  If there are more than three numbers, just keep the first three.  Make sure the letter at the beginning is capitalized.<br>

       <br>
       Ashcroft --> Asroft --> Asrft --> A2613 --> A261<br>
       <br>
       Pfister --> Pister --> Pstr --> P236<br>

       Williams --> Wiliams --> Wlms --> W452<br>

       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob11.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line of each test case will contain a positive integer N denoting the number of names that follow.<br>
       •	The next N lines will contain one name per line.<br>

       <br>
       Your program should print out the list of Soundex codes generated by the list of names (ordered alphabetically) and the number of times that code was generated separated by a space for each test case.  The first line of each test case’s output should be the word OUTPUT.<br>
