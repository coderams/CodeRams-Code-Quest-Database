      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 13<br>This problem has a difficulty of 65</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>

       <br>
       The commutative property of addition means that if you are adding numbers together, it doesn’t matter what order you add them in.  1 + 2 = 3, and 2 + 1 = 3.  You will use this special property of addition to show just how many different ways you can sum up numbers.  Given a list of numbers, you must write a program that finds all possible multiset permutations of these numbers that add up to a specified sum.<br>
       <br>
       What is a multiset permutation?  I’m glad you asked.  It is a permutation of a set of objects (in this case digits) where objects of the same type are freely interchangeable.  In the example input below, the second test case has two ‘1’ digits.  However, the equation 1+1+2 only appears once in the output.  That is because switching the 1s around does not form a new equation, even though they are different instances of the number 1.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       The first line of the file Prob13.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line of each test case will be the sum you need to find in the following format:<br>
       FIND SUM=<positive integer><br>
       •	The second line of each test case will contain a list of positive integers delimited by a comma.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       2<br>
       FIND SUM=10<br>
       2,3,7,1,8<br>
       FIND SUM=4<br>
       2,1,3,1<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Your program should output the all the possible addition equations you can make from the given numbers for the given sum.  You cannot repeat any of the given numbers in your solutions unless the number is repeated in the input list.  Your equations should be ordered in an ascending manner by the first number in the equation, then by the second, and so on.<br>
