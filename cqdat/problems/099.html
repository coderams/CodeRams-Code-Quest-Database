       Word search puzzles have provided a challenging game for all ages since they were first introduced over 40 years ago.  They require a keen eye and plenty of patience to complete.  Seemingly random letters are aligned in a square or rectangular grid.  Generally, they are kept to 30x30 or less but they can be of any size.  Given a list of words, the solver must find every listed word in the grid.  The words can be found in the following different directions: across, up, down, diagonally, and reversed in any direction.   Your task is to create a program that will find the words in the grid.<br>

       The file Prob14.in.txt will contain a grid of uppercase letters.  The grid can be up to any size and will not necessarily be square.  The line above the grid will have the string “#PUZZLE” without the quotes.   Following the grid there will be a list of words, each on a separate line.  The line above the beginning word in the list will have the string “#WORDS” without the quotes.  Remember that the first row and first column of the grid start at 0, not 1.  In the following example, the first letter “J” is at location [0,0], not [1,1].<br>

       The output of your program should list the words, sorted alphabetically, each followed by the beginning letter’s location in the grid in [row,column] coordinate format.  Make sure to place a single space between the word and its location.  Each word / location pair should be on its own line.  All words should be found.  If there are two or more instances of a word found, report the one with the lowest column value coordinate.  If two or more instances have the same x value, report the one with the lowest row value coordinate.<br>
