      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 2<br>This problem has a difficulty of 5</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       Input File:  Prob02.in.txt<br>
       Output: Your output needs to be directed to stdout (i.e., using System.out.println())<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Introduction</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       You work for a beach authority who’s decided to count each and every grain of sand on their beaches.  Luckily for you, there are other teams doing the counting.  Your responsibility is to sum up the counts from each of the teams.  Unfortunately, their counts are much larger than a computer can normally handle.  You might want to search the Java API for a class called BigInteger.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob02.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line will contain a positive integer N denoting the number of teams counting grains of sand<br>
       •	The next N lines will contain each team’s count – one per line<br>
       <br>

      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       For each test case, your program should output one line containing the sum of sand grains from all the teams.<br>
