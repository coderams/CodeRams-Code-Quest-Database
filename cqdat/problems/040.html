      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 3<br>This problem has a difficulty of 10</em></p>      <p id="ptext">      </p><h1 id="spec">Introduction</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Do you know the Triangle Inequality Theorem?  Just in case you don’t, here it is:<br>
       <br>
       The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.<br>
       <br>
       That sounds easy enough, right?  Your job is to write a program that can identify valid triangles.  Not only do you need to determine if the three sides can form a triangle – you also have to tell what type it is.  There are three classifications of triangles:<br>
       <br>
       •	Equilateral triangles have three sides of equal length.<br>
       •	Isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length and one side that is different.<br>
       •	Scalene triangles have no equal side lengths.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob03.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	A single line with three side lengths separated by a comma and a space.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       4<br>
       20, 20, 23<br>
       20, 20, 20<br>
       20, 21, 22<br>
       13, 14, 30<br>
<br>      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       For each test case, your program will output one of the following four output possibilities:<br>
       <br>
       •	Not a Triangle<br>
       •	Equilateral<br>
       •	Isosceles<br>
       •	Scalene<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       Isosceles<br>
       Equilateral<br>
       Scalene<br>
       Not a Triangle<br>
