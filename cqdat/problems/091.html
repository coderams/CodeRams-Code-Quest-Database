      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2013 Problem 6<br>This problem has a difficulty of 25</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Introduction</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       A golf tournament has just completed and everyone is eagerly waiting for the scores to be tabulated so they can eat the free chicken dinner.  The crowd is getting restless and the waiters are starting to sweat.  Write a program that can compute the scores from today’s round of golf based on the input file containing the golfers’ scores and report back the top three scores and the worst score.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The file Prob06.in.txt will contain the list of golfers and their scores for the day.  No two golfers will have the same name, and you can assume that there will be no ties for first, second, third, or last place.  Each line will contain the golfer’s name followed by a colon and a comma delimited list of their scores.  There are 18 holes, and each golfer will play all holes.<br>

       Bob Jones:4,6,3,3,4,3,5,5,4,4,3,3,2,3,4,3,4,4<br>
       Ted Smith:3,3,3,3,4,3,5,5,4,3,3,3,2,3,4,3,4,4<br>
       Taylor Martin:4,4,3,3,4,3,5,6,4,4,4,3,2,3,5,3,5,4<br>

       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Your program should output the first, second, third, and last place golfers and scores by outputting the place in all capital letters followed immediately by a colon, and then followed immediately by the player’s name for that place.  Remember, in golf the lowest score wins!<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       FIRST:Ted Smith<br>
       SECOND:Adam Lee<br>
       THIRD:Mike Davis<br>
       LAST:Brian Foster<br>
