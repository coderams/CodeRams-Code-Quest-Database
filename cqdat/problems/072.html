       <br>
       Sorting is one of the most common things you are asked to do as a programmer.  In fact, higher level languages and third party libraries make it easier to do things like sort numbers without even knowing what’s happening behind the scenes.  We say “no more”!  Today, you will implement the valley sort algorithm on lists of numbers.<br>
       <br>
       What?  You’ve never heard of the valley sort?  That’s because we made it up.  At least we think we did – we Googled it and didn’t find anything similar.  The valley sort goes something like this:<br>
       <br>
       The biggest number should wind up being first in the list after sorting.<br>
       The second biggest number should wind up being last in the list after sorting.<br>
       The third biggest number should wind up being second in the list after sorting.<br>
       The fourth biggest number should wind up being second from the last in the list after sorting.<br>
       <br>
       And so on.  Check the example input and output for a couple of visual examples.  We think they will make sense.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The file Prob03.in.txt will contain several lines of integers ranging from 0 to Integer.MAX_VALUE.  Each line is a list of numbers separated by spaces.  Each line should be run through your valley sort algorithm, and the results printed out.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       5 4 3 2 1<br>
       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Your program should print the valley sorted lists of numbers, one list per line, in the order they were read in.  Separate your numbers by a single space.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       5 3 1 2 4<br>
       10 8 6 4 2 1 3 5 7 9<br>
       <br>
