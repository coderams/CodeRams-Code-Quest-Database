      <h1 id="statement">Problem 003: SufFIX</h1>
      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2018 Problem 3<br>This problem has a difficulty of 10.</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>
       English is a strange language.  We say "first," "second," and "third," but then almost every number after that ends in "th" – "fourth," "fifth," "sixth."  Why can’t they all be the same?<br>
       <br>
       For this problem, someone has tried to "fix" a bunch of ordinal number abbreviations by changing "1st" to "1th," "2nd" to "2th," and so on, and we need you to fix them back.  Solve this quickly and you may end up in firth – I mean, first – place!<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob03.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	A single line with a potentially incorrect ordinal number: an integer followed by the letters "th".<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code">
       <br>
       7<br>
       1th<br>
       2th<br>
       3th<br>
       4th<br>
       10th<br>
       12th<br>
       22th<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       For each test case, your program should print out the number with the correct ordinal suffix.  If the original number was correct, you should print it out as written.<br>
       <br>
