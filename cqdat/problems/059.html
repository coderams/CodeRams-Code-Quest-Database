       If a city or a country wants to measure how much income its residents have, one such measure is called <br>
       “Per Capita Income”.  Per capita income, also known as income per person, is the average income of the people in an economic unit such as a country or city. It is calculated by taking a measure of all sources of income in the aggregate (such as GDP or Gross National Income) and dividing it by the total population.<br>
       <br>
       Besides just knowing the per capita income for a given point in time, it is useful to look at the trend of per capita income over a period of time to diagnose the economic health of an area.  This is where you come in.  You have been asked to create a program that will graph the per capita income of a region over time.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob05.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line of each test case will contain the name of the region<br>
       •	The second line of each test case will contain a positive number N denoting the number of data points for the region<br>
       •	The next N lines will contain two space separated numbers representing a single data point for the region in the following form:<br>
       <br>
       [PER_CAPITA_INCOME] [YEAR]<br>
       <br>
       Where PER_CAPITA_INCOME is a dollar amount that will have two decimal places and year is a four digit year.  Each data point will have a distinct year.<br>
       <br>

       <br>
       Your program should output a horizontal bar graph of the data for each region.  The first line of each region’s output should be the name of the region followed by a colon.  The next N lines should be the data points for that region sorted ascending by their year.  Each line should contain the year followed by a space followed by some number of asterisks.  Each asterisk should correspond to $1000, which means you will need to round the per capita income to the nearest thousand dollars.  See Appendix A for more information on how you should round.<br>
