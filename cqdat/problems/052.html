       <br>
       The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle.  It was invented in 1883 by French mathematician Edouard Lucas.  It consists of three pegs labeled A, B, and C and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any peg.  The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on peg A, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.<br>
       <br>
       The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack from peg A to peg C using peg B to help, obeying the following simple rules:<br>
       1.	Only one disk can be moved at a time.<br>
       2.	Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack; i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.<br>
       3.	No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.<br>
       <br>
       With two disks, the puzzle can be solved in three moves, with three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves.  The minimum number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n - 1, where n is the number of disks.<br>
       <br>
       This puzzle is well known since it touches two important topics.<br>
       •	Recursive functions and stacks<br>
       •	Recurrence relations<br>

       The first line of the file Prob15.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	A single positive integer N denoting the number of disks in the initial stack<br>
       <br>

      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       Your program’s output should be as follows: <br>
       <br>
       •	The first line of each test case’s output should be the number of disks in the stack.<br>
       •	The next 2n – 1 lines should be the disk movements in the form FromPeg->ToPeg.  Since only the top disk can be moved, it is not necessary to print out the disk number.<br>
