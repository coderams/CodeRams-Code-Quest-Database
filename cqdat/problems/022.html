      <p id="sub">    <em>Problem made by Lockheed Martin, is CodeQuest 2017 Problem 3<br>This problem has a difficulty of 5</em></p>      <p id="ptext">       <br>
       Nowadays if you put two things together you need to come up with a cool name to describe the two things together, like Bennifer or Brangelina.  In this problem, you will deal with the concepts of addition and multiplication.  You will Addiply!  Your task is to write a program which does simple addition and multiplication based on 2 input numbers.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob03.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       â€¢	A single line containing two positive integers separated by a space.  The numbers will be small enough that they will not be bigger than Integer.MAX_VALUE when multiplied together.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code">
       <br>
       3<br>
       2 2<br>
       5 4<br>
       3 8<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       For each test case, your program should output 2 numbers: the first will be the result of adding the two input numbers, the other will be the result of multiplying the two input numbers.  Separate your two answers with a single space.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Output:</h1><p id="code">
       <br>
       4 4<br>
