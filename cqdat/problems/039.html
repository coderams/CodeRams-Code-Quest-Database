       Some people really like coins.  You happen to be one of those people!  In a world filled with electronic payments and banking from your cell phone, you prefer to deal exclusively in cash – specifically coins that are generally available (no silver dollars or half dollars for you).  However, you are also practical.  I mean, paying for your lunch in pennies?  That’s just silly.  In order to strike the right balance of quirky and practical, you need to be able to pay for things using the fewest number of coins possible – and your program will help you do just that.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       The first line of the file Prob02.in.txt will contain a positive integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.  Each test case will have the following input:<br>
       <br>
       •	A single line denoting the dollar amount to be converted.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><p id="code"><br>
       4<br>
       $3.87<br>
       $2.74<br>
       $14.84<br>
       $0.76<br>
<br>      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       For each dollar amount given, have your program calculate the fewest number of coins necessary to arrive at that dollar amount.  Your program will output the following:<br>
       <br>
       •	The first line should contain the dollar amount exactly as it appears in the input.<br>
       •	The next line should contain the amount of quarters in the following format: <br>
       o	Quarters=[amount of quarters calculated]<br>
       •	The next line should contain the amount of dimes in the following format: <br>
       o	Dimes=[amount of dimes calculated]<br>
       •	The next line should contain the amount of nickels in the following format: <br>
       o	Nickels=[amount of nickels calculated]<br>
       •	The next line should contain the amount of pennies in the following format:  <br>
       o	Pennies=[amount of pennies calculated]<br>
       •	NOTE: If a coin was not used, still include that coin in the output with a “0” amount (i.e. Pennies=0).<br>
