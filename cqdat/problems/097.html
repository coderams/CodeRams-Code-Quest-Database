       Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.  It is used heavily in the IT world to pass data around from system to system.<br>
       <br>
       XML looks very much like HTML in that XML elements are encased in a set of less than and greater than signs.  End tags are similar but have a slash at the beginning of the element name.  Here is an example:<br>
       <br>
       <img src="../pics/097_A.png" width = 800px>
       <br>
       XML tags can be named whatever you want, and they can be nested (which is what starts to unleash the true power of XML).  Your job is to look through an XML file and list the element names that you find in order and the number of times that element name exists in the XML file.  Remember - do not count the ending tags, only the starting ones!<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Program Input</h1><p id="ptext">
       The file Prob12.in.txt will contain a snippet of XML.  There will be no self-ending elements.  Elements may or may not have any content.<br>
       <br>
      </p><h1 id="spec">Example Input:</h1><br>
      <img src="../pics/097_B.png" left=100px>
       <br>
       <h1 id="spec">Program Output</h1><p id="ptext">
       <br>
       Your program should print out the names of every XML element in the file in the order that you come across them, along with the number of times that element exists in the file separated by a space.<br>
